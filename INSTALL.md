# Install guide

This is a simple guide how to install and use Tracker for your Slack 
organization. It's easy and it shouldn't take you more than 15 minutes. If you
want to improve this guide, send us PR please.

## Requirements

- Server with SSL - Foursquare push requires HTTPS, this project is Heroku ready
so we suggest to go with that option if you don't have SSL
- Node version 4+ - We use Koa framework that is based on generators, this 
project would probably work with iojs or 0.10.x ans 0.12.x node versions with
harmony flag, but it's not tested with them.
- Slack organization
- Foursquare account
